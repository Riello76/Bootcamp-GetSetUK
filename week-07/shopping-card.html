    <h2>Shopping Card</h2>
    <div class="shop">
        <div class="card">

            <h2 class="coffee-type">Flat White</h2>
            <p>
              This is the type of coffee you generally will see when looking for
              coffee images on Google.
            </p>
 
            <p>
              It is the one barista use for their coffee arts, and it is actually
              very easy to make.
            </p>
 
            <p>
              Take a cup, fill half of it with coffee, fill the remaining half
              with milk. You have just done a cup of flat white.
            </p>
 
            <strong>
              This type usually contains more coffee that other the majority of
              the other types why have seen in this post, more coffee means more
              caffeine.
            </strong>
 
            <p>
              This is the reason I believe this is a very good option for the web
              developers that are approaching deadlines.
