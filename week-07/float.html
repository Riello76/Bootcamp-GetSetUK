        A boat is a watercraft of a large range of types and sizes, but
        generally smaller than a ship, which is distinguished by its larger
        size, shape, cargo or passenger capacity, or its ability to carry boats.
        Small boats are typically found on inland waterways such as rivers and
        lakes, or in protected coastal areas.
