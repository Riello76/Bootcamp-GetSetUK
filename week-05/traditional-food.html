    <h1>Traditional Italian Food</h1>
    <h2>Lasagna</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Lasagne al forno, layered with a thicker ragù and béchamel sauce and corresponding to the most common version of
        the dish outside Italy, is traditionally associated with the <strong>Emilia-Romagna region of Italy. </strong>
        Here, and especially in its capital, <span style="color: blue;"><strong>Bologna</strong></span>, layers of
        lasagna are traditionally green (the colour is obtained by mixing spinach or other vegetables into the dough)
        and served with ragù <span
            style="background-color: gold; font-weight: bold; font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;"> (a thick
            sauce made from <em>onions,</em> carrots, celery, finely ground pork and beef, butter, and
            tomatoes)</span>,<span style="color: darkblue;"><strong>bechamel</strong></span> and <strong
            style="color: blue;">Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.</strong>
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
        In other regions, lasagna can be made with various combinations of ricotta or mozzarella cheese, tomato sauce,
        meats (such as ground beef, pork or chicken), and vegetables (such as spinach, zucchini, olives, mushrooms), and
        the dish is typically flavoured with wine, garlic, onion, and oregano. In all cases, the lasagne are baked (al
        forno).

    <span style="color: blue;">The lasagna of Naples</span>, lasagne di carnevale, is layered with local sausage, small
    fried meatballs, hard-boiled eggs, ricotta and mozzarella cheeses, and sauced with a Neapolitan ragù, a meat sauce.

        <li>750g lean beef mince</li>
        <li>90g pack prosciutto</li>
        <li>800g passata or half our basic tomato sauce</li>
        <li>200ml hot beef stock</li>
        <li>nutmeg</li>
        <li>300g fresh lasagne sheets</li>
        <li>white sauce (find a recipe in the method, or use shop-bought)</li>
        <li>125g ball mozzarella, torn into thin strips</li>

    </ol>
    <h3 style="text-align: center;">Method</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> STEP 1<br>
            To make the meat sauce, heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a frying pan and cook 750g lean beef mince in two batches
            for about 10 mins until browned all over.</li><br>

        <li>STEP 2<br>
            Finely chop 4 slices of prosciutto from a 90g pack, then stir through the meat mixture.</li><br>

        <li> STEP 3
            Pour over 800g passata or half our basic tomato sauce recipe and 200ml hot beef stock. Add a little grated
            nutmeg, then season.</li><br>

        <li>STEP 4<br>
            Bring up to the boil, then simmer for 30 mins until the sauce looks rich.</li><br>

        <li>STEP 5<br>
            Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and lightly oil an ovenproof dish (about 30 x 20cm).</li><br>

        <li> STEP 6<br>
            Spoon one third of the meat sauce into the dish, then cover with some fresh lasagne sheets from a 300g pack.
            Drizzle over roughly 130g ready-made or homemade white sauce.</li><br>

        <li> STEP 7<br>
            Repeat until you have three layers of pasta. Cover with the remaining 390g white sauce, making sure you
            can’t see any pasta poking through.</li><br>

        <li>STEP 8<br>
            Scatter 125g torn mozzarella over the top.</li><br>

        <li>STEP 9<br>
            Arrange the rest of the prosciutto on top. Bake for 45 mins until the top is bubbling and lightly browned.
